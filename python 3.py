"""today I  learn about variable and  data type.
   In data type I learn about different type of data like
    int, float and and complexes in numerical data 
    in text type data it's string(str)
    and in boolean data there is only{true} and {false} 
    about sequence data like list and tuple 
    where list is mutable but tuple is inmutabl means tuple deos not change."""

 #this all this is is variable and the data in it is numeric type data 
a1="biginners"
b1="coder"
c1="learning python"
    
#now print all variables of each type 
print(a)
print(b) 
print(c)

 #do some addition
print(a+b)
print(c+b)
print(a+c)
print(a+b+c)

print ("the type of a is", type (a))
print ("the type of b is ",type(b))
print("the type of c is",type(c))

##now we wrote about text data type
print(a1)
print(b1) 
print(c1)

print(a1+b1)
print(a1+b1+c1)


print ("the type of a1 is", type(a1))
